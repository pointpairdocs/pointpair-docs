title: "PointPair API Reference"
---

The PointPair API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL
Please note that currently, only API calls from the United States are supported. You can make API calls to:
```bash
https://api.us.pointpair.com/v1
```

## Authentication
PointPair API uses API key-based authentication. You need to include your unique API key and Secret key in the `API_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` Authentication header using Basic Authentication for each API request.
You can view your API keys in the [PointPair Dashboard](https://portal.us.pointpair.com/). Test mode api keys have the prefix `test_` and live mode api keys have the prefix `live_`. There is only one secret key.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Basic <YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
```
